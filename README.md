Companion Repository for my YouTube Series

## Introduction

Hello intrepid Terraformer! You've found the Terraform Basics repository, the companion to my YouTube series that covers the bedrock concepts behind Terraform. Within this repository you will find code examples that correspond to what you saw on the videos.

Please not that although many files contain example code, the code itself is often not a complete working example. Instead, it exists to help me create the videos and as a starting point for your own adventures. You can certainly take the examples and create working Terraform code from them.

Each video has its own directory, and within that directory you will find a README.md file that contains a link to the video, and a list of the files that are used in that video. You can also find the list of videos below.
